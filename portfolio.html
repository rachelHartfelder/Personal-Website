                    <p>Over winter break, I created a personal portfolio website for people to browse and learn more about me! This project helped me develop my knowledge in HTML and CSS, advancing my skills in the language. </p>

                    <p>My final project within Girls Who Code was an activist toolkit website. Using HTML and CSS I created a website focused on helping dogs in animal shelters. My website includes a home page, a take action page, resources page, as well as an about page, all of which explain my goals and try and convince the user of the website to adopt!</p>

                    <p>My second project within the Girls Who Code program was a personailty quiz. With my new knowledge of HTML and CSS I decided to create a quiz that determines which Animal Crossing character the user is. The quiz consists of 5 questions that ask the user about their interests and personality. With the information from the questions, my quiz determines which character from Animal Crossing the user is most similar to. </p>

                    <p>This was my first personal portfolio website that I created while participating in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. This project served as an introductory for HTML and CSS. It consists of three pages: home, portfolio, and a dog blog. With this project I was able to explore some of the many features that HTML and CSS provides.</p>
